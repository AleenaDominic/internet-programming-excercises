            <h1 class="m_myclass2">Social media</h1><br>
           <p class="m_myclass3"> Online social media like Facebook (recently re-branded as Meta Platforms), Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, Whatsapp, and Tik Tok have been with us a comparatively short time. Yet their growth has been astronomical!

            Older electronic media, TV and radio, couldn't reach into the personal private lives in the same intimate one to one, person to person way. Neither could print.

            Social media companies are not responsible for how people use them.

            Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, Whatsapp and Tik Tok although newer players share, to a lesser degree, similar capacities.
        </p><br>
        <p class="m_myclass4">
            The power and influence Facebook users have been able to exert is unparalleled. As a society we've never seen this before.
